Let them know that you value verbal expressions of affection and that it would mean a lot to you if they could express their feelings in words. Be sure to listen to their perspective as well, and try to understand where they're coming from.\n",
            "2. **Understand their love language**: People express love and affection in different ways, and some might not be as verbal as others. Perhaps the person shows their love and care through actions, such as cooking meals, giving gifts, or spending quality time together. Try to recognize and appreciate these non-verbal expressions of affection.\n",
            "3. **Don't take it personally**: It's possible that the person's inability to express their emotions verbally is not a reflection of their feelings for you, but rather a result of their own emotional struggles or upbringing. Try not to take it personally and avoid assuming that they don't care about you.\n",
            "4. **Focus on the positive**: Instead of dwelling on what's not being said, focus on the positive aspects of your relationship. Appreciate the time you spend together, the laughter you share, and the memories you create.\n",
            "5. **Show affection in your own way**: If the person is not verbal about their emotions, you can still show your affection and love in your own way. Write them love notes, give them hugs, or surprise them with small gifts. This can help create a sense of mutual affection and appreciation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Remember that everyone is unique, and people express their emotions in different ways. By being understanding, patient, and open-minded, you can navigate these situations and build stronger, more meaningful relationships.\n",
