# Mental-Health-Chatbot-Using-GEN-AI
A conversational AI chatbot built with Groq Cloud, LangChain, and HuggingFace embeddings to provide mental health support through data-driven, compassionate responses.

GenAI: A Simple Guide
Project Overview üåü
In this project, I built a Mental Health Chatbot using GenAI technology. The idea is to create a bot that responds thoughtfully to users who need mental health support. I used HuggingFace embeddings and Groq API to make sure the chatbot gives helpful and kind responses. This chatbot can assist people who might need someone to talk to in a crisis or just for support.

Steps I Followed to Build the Chatbot üöÄ
Step 1: Setting Up the Environment üîß
The first thing I did was sign in to Groq Cloud and generate an API key. This key is essential to connect to the Groq platform and use its powerful AI models. After logging in, I created a new project and got my API key. I made sure to save it somewhere safe because it would be used later in the code.

Step 2: Configuring Google Colab üìù
After getting the API key, I opened Google Colab, which is a great platform to write and run Python code. In Colab, I started by installing the necessary libraries that the chatbot would need. These libraries include LangChain, ChromaDB, and Groq API.

Here's what I added to my code:

python
Copy
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader, DirectoryLoader
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
import os
from langchain_groq import ChatGroq
Step 3: Initializing the Language Model (LLM) ‚öôÔ∏è
Next, I wrote a function to initialize the ChatGroq model. This model is very efficient and helps to run AI tasks quickly, which is important for the chatbot to give fast responses. I used my Groq API key here.

python
Copy
def initialize_llm():
    llm = ChatGroq(
        temperature = 0,
        groq_api_key = "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
        model_name = "llama-3.3-70b-versatile"
    )
    return llm
Step 4: Checking the create_vector_db() Function ‚úÖ
Before moving forward, I checked if the create_vector_db() function was working correctly. This function is very important because it helps load and manage the documents that the chatbot uses to give better answers. I made sure everything was running well before proceeding to the next steps.

Step 5: Setting Up the Vector Database üìö
I needed a way to store and manage the text data for the chatbot to use. So, I created a vector database using ChromaDB. I split large documents into smaller chunks and used HuggingFace embeddings to represent the text as vectors. This made it easier for the chatbot to understand and respond based on the stored information.

python
Copy
def create_vector_db():
    loader = DirectoryLoader("/content/data", glob = '*.pdf', loader_cls = PyPDFLoader)
    documents = loader.load()
    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size = 500, chunk_overlap = 50)
    texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
    embeddings = HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings(model_name = 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    vector_db = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings, persist_directory = './chroma_db')
    vector_db.persist()

    print("ChromaDB created and data saved")

    return vector_db
Step 6: Setting Up the Q&A Chain üîÑ
After that, I used LangChain's RetrievalQA to set up the question-answering part of the chatbot. This is where the chatbot can take input from users, search the vector database for relevant information, and then give an answer. To make sure the responses are kind and helpful, I created a PromptTemplate.

python
Copy
def setup_qa_chain(vector_db, llm):
    retriever = vector_db.as_retriever()
    prompt_templates = """ You are a compassionate mental health chatbot. Respond thoughtfully to the following question:
        {context}
        User: {question}
        Chatbot: """
    PROMPT = PromptTemplate(template = prompt_templates, input_variables = ['context', 'question'])

    qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
        llm = llm,
        chain_type = "stuff",
        retriever = retriever,
        chain_type_kwargs = {"prompt": PROMPT}
    )
    return qa_chain
Step 7: Main Function and Running the Chatbot ü§ñ
Finally, I wrote the main function to run everything. This function loads the vector database, sets up the chatbot, and starts a loop where users can ask the chatbot questions. The bot will keep chatting until the user types "exit".

python
Copy
def main():
    print("Initializing Chatbot.........")
    llm = initialize_llm()

    db_path = "/content/chroma_db"

    if not os.path.exists(db_path):
        vector_db  = create_vector_db()
    else:
        embeddings = HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings(model_name = 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
        vector_db = Chroma(persist_directory=db_path, embedding_function=embeddings)
    qa_chain = setup_qa_chain(vector_db, llm)

    while True:
        query = input("\nHuman: ")
        if query.lower() == "exit":
            print("Chatbot: Take Care of yourself, Goodbye!")
            break
        try:
            response = qa_chain.run(query)
            print(f"Chatbot: {response}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Chatbot: An error occurred: {e}")
        print("Loop continues")
Key Learnings and Skills Gained üìö
Working with Cloud APIs: I learned how to use Groq Cloud and integrate it with my code to access advanced AI models.
Using LangChain: I became comfortable using LangChain to create a conversational AI that can search documents and respond to users.
NLP Basics: I got a better understanding of text embeddings, vector databases, and how to use them to help the chatbot understand and respond in a meaningful way.
Problem-Solving: I also worked on fixing errors and issues that came up, which helped improve my debugging and problem-solving skills.
Ethical Concerns ‚öñÔ∏è
While this chatbot can help people with mental health support, there are a few ethical things to think about:

Data Privacy: It‚Äôs really important to make sure users' personal data is safe and private when they talk to the chatbot.
Bias in Responses: Sometimes, AI can give biased answers, especially if the data it was trained on is biased. This can be risky when giving mental health advice.
Over-reliance on AI: The chatbot should not replace human professionals. It‚Äôs meant to be a helpful tool, but people still need real support when necessary.
Content Moderation: The chatbot should be able to detect harmful or unsafe content and respond appropriately to ensure the safety of users.
How It Can Help the Modern World üåç
This chatbot can play an important role in mental health care by providing a scalable solution. Many people struggle with mental health, and sometimes they don‚Äôt have easy access to professionals. The chatbot can offer instant, compassionate support when someone needs it.

Though it‚Äôs not a replacement for therapy, it can serve as a first point of contact and be a helpful tool for anyone looking for support. In the future, such AI tools can become even more helpful in providing mental health care worldwide.

Conclusion ‚ú®
I successfully built this chatbot using Groq Cloud, LangChain, and HuggingFace embeddings. Along the way, I learned new things about AI, cloud computing, and ethics in AI. This project showed me how AI can be used responsibly to help people with mental health issues and how it can grow into something even more useful.
